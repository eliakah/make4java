# To enabled incremental compilation you need the "jdeps" utility
# (available in OpenJDK 1.8). If not found it will revert to full
# compilation every time one or more source files are modified or
# added.
#
# NOTE: Only file modification and/or addition is supported, that is,
#       if a (re)source file is removed you have to perform a full
#       compilation ("make clean compile") in order to get rid of the
#       old classes and "filtered" resources.
#
# If you want to use jdeps but don't want to generate 1.8 bytecode,
# just pass the JAVAC variable to "configure", e.g.:
#
#   ./configure "JAVAC=javac -source 1.7 -target 1.7 -bootclasspath \
#                /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk/jre/lib/rt.jar"
#
# Choose appropriate source, target and bootclasspath's values for you
# project.
#
# NOTE: For small projects a full compilation may be faster than an
#       incremental compilation followed by a jdeps run. In such cases
#       you may wish to run "configure" with the "--disable-jdeps"
#       option.

# Enable support for distinct "build tree" and "source tree"

# build.mk's variables and macros #
###################################

# For each external dependency (see EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES_DIR above),
# component's JAR library or native library, the following "library
# variables" will be defined:
#   <libname>.version   - version of the library
#   <libname>.basename  - file name of the library, without path
#   <libname>.buildname - file name of the library, with path relative
#                         to the project's topmost directory
#   <libname>.jarname   - file name of the library, with path relative
#                         to the root directory of an including JAR,
#                         i.e., in case this library is included within
#                         some component's JAR archive, this variable
#                         will tell where it is to be found *inside* the
#                         JAR archive
# where <libname> is the name of the JAR/native library file without the
# .jar or .so extension nor the version number.
# The PARSE_LIB_AND_VER, BUILD_MAKE_RULES and BUILD_NATIVE_MAKE_RULES
# macros will define them. They are described here as their main use is
# to be listed in the RESOURCE_PLACEHOLDERS variable (see below) to
# provide values to filter the resources with. Of course, you can employ
# them wherever you see fit, e.g., to define new rules.
# NOTE: <libname>.version and <libname>.jarname are automatically added
#       to the RESOURCE_PLACEHOLDERS variable

# NOTE: We need two convertion macros to solve a chicken-egg dependency
#       issue.
#       When compiling for the first time, or after a clean, the
#       dependencies files included by the 'include' directive in the
#       BUILD_NATIVE_COMPILE_RULES macro don't exist and must be created
#       by the rule next to the 'include' directive. But the JNI headers
#       they depend on don't exist either and if it were not for the
#       '-MG' option the recipe would fail. Instead the dependencies
#       files are created despite the error, but using file names for
#       the JNI headers taken from the C '#include' directives, that is,
#       in their "short" version -- without full path. To allow 'make'
#       to build the JNI header files, despite the wrong file names
#       used, we must define targets for the JNI header files using the
#       wrong "short" names -- that's what the first macro is used for.
#       Once the JNI header files are built, the dependencies files will
#       be rebuilt, this time, however, the JNI header files do exist
#       enabling the C preprocessor to compute the correct "full" names
#       of the headers. So now we need a different set of targets to
#       deal with the "full" version of the file names -- that's the
